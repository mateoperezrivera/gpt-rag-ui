# GPT-RAG Web UI

Part of the [GPT-RAG](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag) solution.

This repo provides a user interface built with [Chainlit](https://www.chainlit.io/) to interact with GPT-powered retrieval-augmented generation systems. It is designed to work seamlessly with the Orchestrator backend and supports customization and theming.

## Documentation

For comprehensive information about GPT-RAG, including architecture details, configuration guides, best practices, troubleshooting resources, deployment guidance, customization options, and advanced usage scenarios, please refer to the [official project documentation](https://azure.github.io/GPT-RAG/).

## Prerequisites

Provision the infrastructure first by following the GPT-RAG repository instructions [GPT-RAG](https://github.com/azure/gpt-rag). This ensures all required Azure resources (e.g., Container App, Storage, AI Search) are in place before deploying the web application.

## Deployment steps

Make sure you're logged in to Azure before anything else:

```bash
az login
```

### Deploying the app with azd (recommended)

Initialize the template:
```shell
azd init -t azure/gpt-rag-ui 
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use the **same environment name** with `azd init` as in the infrastructure deployment to keep components consistent.

Update env variables then deploy:
```shell
azd env refresh
azd deploy 
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Run `azd env refresh` with the **same subscription** and **resource group** used in the infrastructure deployment.

### Deploying the app with a shell script

To deploy using a script, first clone the repository, set the App Configuration endpoint, and then run the deployment script.

##### PowerShell (Windows)

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag-ui.git
$env:APP_CONFIG_ENDPOINT = "https://<your-app-config-name>.azconfig.io"
cd gpt-rag-ui
.\scripts\deploy.ps1
```

##### Bash (Linux/macOS)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag-ui.git
export APP_CONFIG_ENDPOINT="https://<your-app-config-name>.azconfig.io"
cd gpt-rag-ui
./scripts/deploy.sh
````
